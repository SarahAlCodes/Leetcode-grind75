## About
<p>
As I prep for technical interviews, I will complete the leetcode grind75 questions. This repo will provide my solutions along with the space and time complexities of each challenge.

## Optimizations
* Through each coding challenge, I used pseudocode to break down what the question was asking me to return, what data types were being used, and what steps needed to be taken to reach the solution. 
* Time and space complexity are factors in optimizing each coding challenge and improving such technical skills.
* Throughout this process, I have been able to consistently code each day, while building better coding skills that increase readability and efficiency in each line of code.


## What Was Learned
* Consistency outweighs dedication, one can be dedicated to coding but creating healthy habits that are consistent will get you much further.
* Studying basic data structures and algorithms after solving rigorous coding problems will help in understanding the solutions.
* Break down each problem by parameters, return, examples, and pseudocode before solving to fully comprehend what the question is asking.
